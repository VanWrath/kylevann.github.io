            <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
            <p>
             Growing up as a teen, I always wanted to make video games. With the wide popularity of the Unity3D game engine, I decided to learn how to develop games using C# and Unity. The first
             game I wanted to try to make is the classic platformer game. The game rules are simple, you traverse through the level while collecting coins and get to the end of the level. But there
                is a Boss at the end of the level which you have to defeat in order to clear the level.

            <h1><b>Process</b></h1>
            <p>
                After learning how to use Unity for 2D game development, I started off with sketching a design for the level. I wanted to keep the level short and simple, so it wouldn't take too 
                long to build out the level, but enough to learn and apply the fundamentals of creating a platformer game. I then searched for assets, such as sprites, music, and sound. After 
                acquiring the assets I needed, I worked on the front end of the game first, creating the animations controllers and the level layout. After that, I started implementing the physics
                and movement, since its the most important part of the game, then everything else afterwords.
