    <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
    <p>
        Growing up as a teen, I always wanted to make video games. With the wide popularity of the Unity3D game engine, I decided to learn how to develop games using C# and Unity. The first
        game I wanted to try to make is the classic platformer game.

    <h1><b>Process</b></h1>
    <p>
        After learning how to use Unity for 2D game development, I started off with sketching a design for the level. I wanted to keep the level short and simple, so it wouldn't take too 
        long to build out the level, but enough to learn and apply the fundamentals of creating a platformer game. I then searched for assets, such as sprites, music, and sound. After 
        acquiring the assets I needed, I worked on the front end of the game first before working on the back end.
