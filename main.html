                I'm Kyle Vannarath, a software developer. I graduated from York University with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Computer Science. 
                I enjoy developing software as it pushes my problem-solving skills to the test.

            <p>
                I have developed a few projects while learning different programming languages and skills. Currently, I am working on a chatbot for the Discord app as a personal project. 
                But while Iâ€™m not programming, you would usually find me playing video games, exercising, or tinkering with electronics.
